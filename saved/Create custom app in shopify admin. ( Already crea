1. Create custom app in shopify admin. ( Already created, created Oauth credentials )
2. Configure API scopes in shopify admin

3. Grab Graphql URL aka POST 'https://{store_name}.myshopify.com/admin/api/2022-07/graphql.json'

4. This is in the header:
	a. X-Shopify-Access-Token: application/json
	b. include access token as a header / Postman
		'X-Shopify-Access-Token: -- ( access token goes here ) --'

5. Create query for graphql
	{
		"query": "{ 
			products(first: 10) 
				{
				edges {
					node {
						{ 
							id title
						}
					}
				}
				}
			}"
	}

Notes:
All requests should use authenticated fetch function from app bridge utils
NGROK must be installed, apparently...
App created in admin needs the app URL to be the NGROK tunnel url
Install dotenv
SHopify node library

Session tokens are created by app-bridge

Site: JWT.io to test session tokens


.env file example:

SHOPIFY_API_KEY={api key}           # Your API key
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET={api secret key} # Your API secret key
SHOPIFY_API_SCOPES={scopes}                     # Your app's required scopes, comma-separated
HOST={your app's host}              # Your app's host, without the protocol prefix

Essential on the front end:
	App-Bridge
	App-Bridge React
	App-Brighe Utils

	Provider to encapsulate app. Raps the app in App.js, I believe. Need to cofirm this. 

Backend Packages:
	Shopify-api library 
	import Shopify, { ApiVersion } from '@shopify/shopif-api';

	koa = verify request includes verifyToken()
