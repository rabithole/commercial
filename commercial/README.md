# To Do List
### Add env variables

### Add restrictions to making duplicate companies etc
### Restrict company delettion process
### Add primary contact process? Rethinking this process and the need for it. 

### Format zip code input to be number. Can't limit length with type='number'. maxLength only works with text. 
### Think about duplicate emails in regards to the possibility an employee could work for or move to a new company and want to use a personal email. Should email be unique? 
### Casacade deletion of employees when their company is deleted.

### Create process for employee to send add company info to a client.

### Add checks to stop accidental deletions
#### Redirect after company deletions.

// Employee / Employees
### Password is in employee table. Need to reconfigure
### Add validation for employee creation form

# Questions for Brett
### Same employee at multiple companies. Is this a problem? 
### Setting a primary employee


# Potential Bugs
### There will be two state objects for company info due to no company graphql enpoint. 
### Possible a DIG employee could modify a company from the Shopify admin and affect continuity between our API and Shopify's admin API. 






# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
